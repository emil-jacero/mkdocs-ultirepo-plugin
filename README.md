# mkdocs-ultirepo-plugin

## Summary

The ultimate plugin for merging documentation in many ways for mkdocs

## TODO

* [ ] Add the ability to reference a directory that does not include the `nav.yml` or `nav.yaml`.
* [ ] Add support for the automatic reload on file update.
* [ ] Reworking the git_clone module to gracefully fail and remove the `include` from the nav instead of erroring out. Make it optional
